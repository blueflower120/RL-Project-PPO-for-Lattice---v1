# RL-Project-PPO-for-Lattice---v1
A 10 * 10 lattice environment is created to test my understanding of the PPO algorithm. An agent and the destination are generated at the origin and a random location at first of each game, respectively. The aim of this project is to make the agent find the way to the destination itself after training.
